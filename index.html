                <p>
                    Born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. He was
                    sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with
                    distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing
                    nationalism to be a higher calling. <br>Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist
                    movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to
                    leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open
                    to socialism. Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939. In April 1941 Bose
                    arrived in Nazi Germany, where the leadership offered unexpected but equivocal sympathy for India's
                    independence. German funds were employed to open a Free India Centre in Berlin. A 3,000-strong Free
                    India Legion was recruited from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps to serve
                    under Bose. Although peripheral to their main goals, the Germans inconclusively considered a land
                    invasion of India throughout 1941. By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in Russia and
                    Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories. Adolf Hitler
                    during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 offered to arrange a submarine. During this time,
                    Bose became a father; his wife, or companion, Emilie Schenkl, gave birth to a baby girl. Identifying
                    strongly with the Axis powers, Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943. Off Madagascar, he
                    was transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May
                    1943. <br>

                    With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), which comprised Indian
                    prisoners of war of the Indian Army who had been captured by the Japanese in the Battle of
                    Singapore. A Provisional Government of Free India was declared on the Japanese-occupied Andaman and
                    Nicobar Islands and was nominally presided by Bose. Although Bose was unusually driven and
                    charismatic, the Japanese considered him to be militarily unskilled, and his soldierly effort was
                    short-lived. In late 1944 and early 1945, the Indian Army reversed the Japanese attack on India.
                    Almost half the Japanese forces and the participating INA contingent were killed. The remaining INA
                    was driven down the Malay Peninsula and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore. Bose chose to
                    escape to Manchuria to seek a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to have turned
                    anti-British. He died from third-degree burns received when his overloaded plane crashed in Japanese
                    Taiwan on August 18, 1945. Some Indians did not believe that the crash had occurred, expecting Bose
                    to return to secure India's independence. The Indian National Congress, the main instrument of
                    Indian nationalism, praised Bose's patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology.
                    The British Raj, never seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the
                    INA trials, but eventually backtracked in the face of opposition by the Congress, and a new mood in
                    Britain for rapid decolonisation in India. Bose's legacy is mixed. Among many in India, he is the
                    muscular hero, his saga serving as a would-be counterpoise to the many actions of regeneration,
                    negotiation, and reconciliation over a quarter-century through which the independence of India was
                    achieved. His collaborations with Japanese Fascism and Nazism pose serious ethical dilemmas,
                    especially his reluctance to publicly criticize the worst excesses of German anti-Semitism from 1938
                    onwards or to offer refuge in India to its victims.
